# Llama 3.1-8B Evaluation Results Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the evaluation results for the Llama 3.1-8B model on the poker action prediction task. The model was tested on 10,000 examples to assess its ability to predict poker actions correctly.

## Key Findings

- **Overall Performance**:
  - Average accuracy: 17.27%
  - Action accuracy: 17.95%
  - Value accuracy (for bet/raise): 0.28%

- **Action-Specific Performance**:
  - Check: 24.40% accuracy (2,500 examples)
  - Call: 26.08% accuracy (2,500 examples)
  - Fold: 14.24% accuracy (2,500 examples)
  - Bet: 11.79% accuracy, 0.63% value accuracy (950 examples)
  - Raise: 4.19% accuracy, 0.06% value accuracy (1,550 examples)

- **Multiple Actions Issue**:
  - 52.96% of predictions contained multiple actions
  - These were counted as incorrect predictions

## Analysis

1. **Poor Overall Performance**: The model achieves less than 20% accuracy across all metrics, indicating significant difficulty with the poker action prediction task.

2. **Action Type Performance Variation**: 
   - The model performs best on "call" and "check" actions
   - Performance on "bet" and especially "raise" actions is extremely poor

3. **Value Prediction Challenge**: 
   - The model struggles severely with predicting correct bet/raise values
   - Only 0.63% of bet values and 0.06% of raise values were predicted correctly

4. **Multiple Actions Problem**: 
   - Over half the predictions contain multiple actions
   - This suggests the model has difficulty producing a single, decisive action

## Distribution Analysis

- **Ground Truth Distribution**:
  - Well balanced with 2,500 examples each for check, call, and fold
  - 950 bet examples and 1,550 raise examples

- **Prediction Distribution**:
  - 5,296 predictions with multiple actions (labeled as "null")
  - 2,909 "unknown" predictions
  - Significant imbalance toward call (652) and check (610) actions
  - Very few bet (112) and raise (65) predictions

## Recommendations

1. **Improve Action Filtering**: Implement stronger constraints in the prompt or post-processing to ensure single action outputs.

2. **Enhance Value Prediction**: Focus training or fine-tuning specifically on bet/raise value predictions.

3. **Balance Prediction Distribution**: The model appears biased against predicting bet and raise actions. Consider training techniques to address this imbalance.

4. **Specialized Training**: Consider separate models or specialized training for the more challenging bet/raise actions.

5. **Extended Context**: Provide more game context to help the model make better decisions, especially for complex actions.
