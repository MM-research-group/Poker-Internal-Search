You are a professional poker player known for your deep strategic insight in 6-player no-limit hold'em. Given the following game state and knowing that the solver has determined the optimal action to be {optimal_action}, please provide a detailed chain-of-thought explanation for why this action is the best choice. In your explanation, consider the following:
- What is my opponent's range here? Is their range capped or uncapped?
- What is our hand? (value, showdown value, bluff)
- Given the opponent's range, what can we do about it?
- Risk management, pot odds, stack sizes (when necessary)
- Future street considerations and board texture
- Given all of your considerations, determine the relative importance of each factor and use the most important factors to determine the optimal action.

Only use factors that make sense given the current game state. Break down your reasoning step by step, ensuring that each part logically follows from the game state. Assume your opponent is playing optimally.

Game State: {gamestate}
Optimal Action: {optimal_action}

Please provide your chain-of-thought explanation along with a brief summary of the main points.

You are an expert in poker board texture analysis for 6-player no-limit hold'em. Your task is to evaluate the portion of the chain-of-thought reasoning below that discusses the board cards and texture based on the provided game state.

Your tasks are:

Board Analysis Verification:
- Analyze the reasoning that discusses the board texture, connectivity, and potential draws.
- Evaluate whether the explanation correctly identifies key board characteristics like wetness/dryness, paired boards, and draw possibilities.
- Verify the accuracy of statements about coordinated cards, flush possibilities, straight possibilities, and other texture-related observations.
- Check if the reasoning correctly assesses the board's interaction with potential hand ranges.
- Flag any inaccuracies, misinterpretations, or omissions in the board analysis and provide corrections.

Output Requirements:
- Provide a revised version of the board analysis section with corrections applied.
- Include a brief summary of the changes you made.
- If the explanation is missing a board analysis, make sure to add your analysis.

You are an expert in poker range analysis for 6-player no-limit hold'em. Your task is to evaluate the portion of the chain-of-thought reasoning below that discusses the opponent's potential holdings based on the provided game state and betting actions.

Your tasks are:

Opponent Range Analysis Verification:
- Analyze the reasoning that identifies the opponent's possible holdings, considering their pre-flop, flop, and subsequent actions.
- Evaluate whether the explanation logically categorizes the opponentâ€™s range into segments such as made hands, draws, and potential bluffs.
- Assess if the explanation provides an accurate estimation of the proportion or likelihood of various holdings (e.g., the balance between draws and made hands).
- Flag any inaccuracies, misinterpretations, or omissions in the opponent range analysis and provide corrections.

Output Requirements:
- Provide a revised version of the opponent range estimation section with corrections applied.
- Include a brief summary of the changes you made.
- If the explanation is missing an range analysis, make sure to add your analysis.

You are an expert poker strategist in 6-player no-limit hold'em. Your task is to review a chain-of-thought explanation for determining the optimal action in a specific poker scenario. Below you are provided:
1. The original proposed chain-of-thought explanation.
2. The revised board analysis output.
3. The revised opponent range estimation output.

Please Do the Following:
1. Review the proposed chain-of-thought explanation.
2. Review the revised board analysis output.
3. Review the revised opponent range estimation output.

Now, your task:
- Determine if the corrections make sense, if there are any.
- When determining if board and range analysis makes sense, make sure you're weighing all of the considerations against each other to determine which ones are the most important.
- If the overall coherency and accuracy of the reasoning steps could be improved (ie. remaining hallucinations, inconsistencies, too verbose), make the necessary corrections.

Removal of Optimal Action References:
- Ensure that the final verified reasoning (chain-of-thought explanation) does not include any reference to the optimal action. Remove any such details so that the reasoning stands alone.

Final Output Requirements:
- In your final response, present only the fully revised chain-of-thought explanation that is self-contained, free of any optimal action details, and adheres to strong game theory optimal poker concepts.

Below are the inputs:

Game State: {gamestate}

Optimal Action: {optimal_action}

Original Proposed Reasoning: {proposed_reasoning}

Board Analysis Revision:
{board_output}

Opponent Range Estimation Revision:
{range_estimation_output}

Please proceed step by step in your verification.
